  "prompt": "Generate a comprehensive multi-dimensional sales performance analysis report that shows: the top 15 customers by total order value (calculated as sum of KWMENG across all line items) who have placed orders for both finished goods (MTART = 'FERT') and raw materials (MTART = 'ROH') between February 2025 and July 2025, broken down by sales organization (VKORG), plant (WERKS), and sales document type (AUART), including customer geographic distribution by country code (LAND1) and region (REGIO), material group diversity (count of distinct MATKL values per customer), average order quantities per material type, time-series analysis showing monthly ordering patterns, identification of customers who have ordered materials with unit of measure 'LTR' versus 'KG' versus 'EA', cross-reference with material master last change dates (LAEDA) to identify customers ordering recently updated materials, calculate the ratio of standard orders (OR) to other document types per customer, show plant utilization patterns by identifying which plants (WERKS) process orders for which customer regions, include analysis of order line item complexity (average number of POSNR per VBELN per customer), identify seasonal ordering patterns by correlating ERDAT timestamps with material types and quantities, flag customers with orders spanning multiple sales organizations indicating multi-regional business relationships, calculate customer loyalty metrics based on order frequency and date ranges, cross-analyze customer names containing specific business entity indicators ('Inc', 'LLC', 'Corp', 'Ltd') against their ordering behavior patterns, identify potential bulk customers by finding those with individual line item quantities (KWMENG) exceeding 80 units, correlate customer city locations (ORT01) with preferred material types to identify regional material preferences, and finally rank customers by business complexity score calculated as: (number_of_distinct_materials × number_of_plants_used × number_of_document_types × order_frequency_score) / average_days_between_orders, with detailed breakdowns showing the underlying data supporting each calculated metric, including confidence intervals and data quality indicators for each customer's metrics."
